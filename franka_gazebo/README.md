# Franka Gazebo

**==Important Note:==**

Minimum necessary `franka_description` version is 0.3.0.
You can clone franka_description package from https://github.com/frankarobotics/franka_description.

A project integrating Franka ROS 2 with the Gazebo simulator.

## Launch RVIZ + Gazebo

Launch an example which spawns RVIZ and Gazebo showing the robot:

```bash
ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup visualize_franka_robot.launch.py
```

If you want to display another robot, you can define the robot_type:

```bash
ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup visualize_franka_robot.launch.py robot_type:=fp3
```

If you want to start the simulation including the franka_hand:

```bash
ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup visualize_franka_robot.launch.py load_gripper:=true franka_hand:='franka_hand'
```


## Joint Velocity Control Example with Gazebo

Before starting, be sure to build `franka_example_controllers` and `franka_description` packages.
`franka_description` must have the minimum version of 0.3.0.

```bash
colcon build --packages-select franka_example_controllers
```

Now you can launch the velocity example with Gazebo simulator.

```bash
ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup gazebo_joint_velocity_controller_example.launch.py load_gripper:=true franka_hand:='franka_hand'
```

Keep in mind that the gripper joint has a bug with the joint velocity controller.
If you are interested in controlling the gripper please use joint position interface.


## Joint Position Control Example with Gazebo

To run the joint position control example you need to have the required software listed in the joint velocity control section.

Then you can run with the following command.

```bash
ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup gazebo_joint_position_controller_example.launch.py load_gripper:=true franka_hand:='franka_hand'
```

## Joint Impedance Control Example with Gazebo

For running torque example: 

```bash
ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup gazebo_joint_impedance_controller_example.launch.py load_gripper:=true franka_hand:='franka_hand'
```


## Multi-Robot Joint Velocity Control Example with Gazebo

For running multiple robots simultaneously in Gazebo, each in their own namespace with dedicated URDFs.

First, configure the robots in `/ros2_ws/src/franka_bringup/config/franka.config.yaml`. Uncomment and set `robot_type` for the desired number of robots (e.g., ROBOT1, ROBOT2, ROBOT3).

Multi-robot configurations (positions and controllers) are defined in `franka_gazebo_bringup/config/gazebo_multi_robot_configs.yaml`.

Ensure `franka_example_controllers` and `franka_description` are built.

```bash
colcon build --packages-select franka_example_controllers
```

Then source your workspace.

```bash
source install/setup.sh
```

Then you can run the multi-robot velocity control example.

```bash
ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup multi_robot_gazebo_example.launch.py 
```

This will launch Gazebo with the configured robots, each in their own namespace, with controllers loaded. Use `with_sensors:=true` to enable sensor-enhanced descriptions for `tmrv0_2` robots.


## Throubleshooting

If you experience that Gazebo can't find your model files, try to include the workspace. E.g.

```bash
export GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH=${GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH}:/workspaces/src/
```
